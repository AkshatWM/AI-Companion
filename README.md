# AI-Companion
This project contains the code for the AI Companion app that runs in your browser.

It uses Ollama to run the chat model locally on-device because if She/He isn't running locally on-device, She/He isn't yours.

This project was inspired by Grok AI Companion, so I tried to make something close to that.

Every line of code is hand written so that I can learn to use/practise the languages.

This is an image of how it looks when you use it.

Heads up- I do not own the image of the Anime girl, all rights belong to the original creator.

The Image and System prompt is easily interchangable by users.

# **How can I run this?**
**Prerequisites-** Ollama, A browser, >Python v3.11

Step-1 Install Ollama and Install the model of your choice (Ignore If already done)

Step-2 Clone this repo

Step-3 Open the .JS file in your code editor and change the model name to whatever you are using + go to line 38 and replace "'/no_think\n'+prompt1" depending on whether you are using a non thinking model/you want the model to think.

Step-4 Run the batch file.

Step-5 Enjoy :)
