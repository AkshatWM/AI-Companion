# AI-Companion
This project contains the code for the AI Companion app that runs in your browser.

It uses Ollama to run the chat model locally on-device because if She/He isn't running locally on-device She/He isn't yours.

This project was inspired by Grok AI Companion, so I tried to make something close to that.

Every line of code is hand written so that I can learn to use/practise the languages.

This is an image of how it looks when you use it
