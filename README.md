# AI-Companion
This project contains the code for the AI Companion app that runs in your browser.

It uses Ollama to run the chat model locally on-device because if She/He isn't running locally on-device, She/He isn't yours.

I tried to make the project have some of that Visual Novel Game type of feel to it.

Every line of code is hand written so that I can learn to use/practise the languages.

This is an image of how it looks when you use it.

Heads up- I do not own the image of the Anime girl, all rights belong to the original creator.

The Image and System prompt is easily interchangable by users.
